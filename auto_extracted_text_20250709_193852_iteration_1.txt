I'm willing to do Sales and marketing, Product, and Operations. About Me Intro Hi, my name is Tong, I'm 26 and I went to uni with the hopes of studying medicine, but found financial hardship difficult to overcome during Victoria's COVID-19 lock-downs. That set me on a different path where I could earn and learn simultaneously while completing a trade. My co-founder and I are currently working on Suplmntal, an online platform that places all the worldâ€™s best vocational learning in one convenient place. We're currently being incubated at the Melbourne University InnovatEd program. Life Story I think being strong academically made my high school teachers push me to higher education, which is where I always wanted to go. But I've realised there are students who perform well academically who can't or don't want to go to university. I believe more of these talented students can be made aware of the generous benefits and learning opportunities found through vocational education. Free Time - I tutor trade school classmates in more difficult subjects such as AC Theory and Max Demand - I contribute actively at my local church - I catch-up with my family and friends - I'm an avid Timberwolves fan who watches a lot of basketball but I don't coach or play basketball competitively anymore Other I'm an extremely hard worker who has grit and determination to achieve goals. I'm not technical, but I genuinely believe this is a valuable problem worth addressing for learners and educational providers. My Background Impressive accomplishment - Victorian electrical apprentice of the year: 1st year (winner), 2nd year (nominee), 3rd year (nominee) - Daffyd Lewis Undergraduate Scholarship and Ormond College Scholarship recipient Education Melbourne University, BSc, Biochemistry & Molecular Biology AND Biotechnology, 2021 NECA, Cert III in Electrotechnology (Electrician), 2024 Employment Apprentice Electrician - ASI Electrics - 2021 - 2024 Apprentice Electrician - Vast Electrical - 2024 - 2025 Co-founder - Suplmntal - Current Suplmntal Suplmntal Suplmntal is creating a interactive digital electrical learning textbook with figures, tables, videos and games for vocational educational providers. Bringing vocational education up-to-date with current teaching technologies makes it easier for apprentices to gain great practical skills, understand complex theory, legislation, standards, safety codes, advancements in technology and best practices, professional development, up-skilling and techniques that assists them on-the-job. Progress This problem first presented itself during my first year at trade school back in 2022. But I've only started focusing on it in March 2024 because the difficulty of the content being taught grew significantly while the teaching quality degraded just as significantly. There was just far to much variance in teaching and material quality week to week. Funding Status I haven't raised any equity. I haven't even built a software MVP. I've strictly been talking to trade school teachers and other apprentices about how learning could be better done and what the problems/challenges are with current methods. I've then taken their suggestions and started thinking about how to put it together. About my current co-founder I already have a technical co-founder. Here's their LinkedIn. Why I'm looking for another co-founder Our product requires animation and interactive diagrams for users to learn. UI/UX design, asset generation and animation creation using tools like Figma, Rive and Lottie are not our strengths. Since gamification and interactivity are a core part, we'd love a co-founder with strength in these areas. What I'm looking for in a co-founder I want a co-founder who is technical and in my country (Australia). Ideally, my co-founder is not set on a specific idea, already full-time working on a startup, and aligned with my interests. Ideal co-founder I would love someone technical who sees the value of education. Intelligence isn't only found on university campuses. My time in construction has made me prefer open confrontation and discussion when genuine goals or expectation aren't upheld. I'd rather talk about the issue, even if some processing time is required by my co-founder or I, then let things fester. I think values such as hard work, trustworthiness and integrity are critical. We'd definitely need to talk and see if we align with core values.
